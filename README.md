To properly run program

* Make sure attendance is in the same format
* Everytime you use again, delete "NHS Attendance" so you can add new attendance

1) Upload new file that contains attendance from meeting
2) Rename that attendance file exactly to "NHS Attendance" (Should automatically put .csv at the end)
3) Run the program. Once it says success download the file.
4) Open the csv in google forms, copy just the attendance info and paste into official NHS member sheet.
